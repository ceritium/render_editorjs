# RenderEditorjs

A modular and customizable Ruby renderer for [Editor.js](https://editorjs.io/).

This gem takes inspiration from [editor_js](https://github.com/xiaohui-zhangxh/editor_js).
It copies some code blocks logic and schema validations. The `editor_js` gem
implements the most common blocks. If you don't need any customization, it would make
sense to try it.

In comparison, `RenderEditorjs` (this gem) only implement a few blocks, but you can
customize and extend it with your blocks.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'render_editorjs'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install render_editorjs

## Usage

`RenderEditorjs` expects an Editor.js JSON as input; it can be a JSON serialized
as a string or a Hash.

### Basic usage

```ruby
RenderEditorjs.render(json) #=> HTML...
```

### Common usage

```ruby
renderer = RenderEditorjs::DefaultRenderer.new
document = RenderEditorjs::Document.new(json, renderer)

document.valid? #=> true | false
document.errors #=> Array with the schema errors
document.render #=> HTML...
```

### Advanced usage

Customize the DefaultRenderer adding or overriding blocks:

```ruby
renderer = RenderEditorjs::DefaultRenderer.new("header" => MyCustomHeader.new, "customBlock" => CustomBlock.new)
document = RenderEditorjs::Document.new(json, renderer)
document.render #=> My custom HTML
```

Create your renderer class:

```ruby
renderer = MyOwnRenderer.new
document = RenderEditorjs::Document.new(json, renderer)
document.render #=> My custom HTML
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
